//Configuration Object: define an object named settings. This object contains various settings for making an AJAX (asynchronous JavaScript and XML) request to an API. Here's what each property does:

// "async": true: This specifies that the AJAX request should be asynchronous, meaning it won't block the rest of the page from loading while waiting for a response from the API.
// "scrossDomain": true: There seems to be a typo; it should be "crossDomain" instead of "scrossDomain." It indicates that the request is cross-domain, necessary when making requests to external domains from a different domain.
// "url": This is the URL of the API you want to request data from. It's the CoinGecko API endpoint that fetches the current prices of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Polkadot in USD.
// "method": "GET": This specifies that you're using the HTTP GET method to fetch data from the API.
// "headers": {}: This property is an empty object, indicating that no custom HTTP headers are added to the request.

    polka.innerHTML = response.polkadot.usd;
});
// $.ajax(settings) sends an AJAX request to the URL specified in the settings object.
// .done(function(response){ ... }) is a callback function that gets executed when the AJAX request is successfully completed.
// Inside the callback function:

// response contains the data received from the API.
// btc.innerHTML = response.bitcoin.usd; updates the content of the HTML element with the ID "bitcoin" with the current price of Bitcoin (in USD) obtained from the API response.
// eth.innerHTML = response.ethereum.usd; similarly updates the content of the HTML element with the ID "ethereum" with the current price of Ethereum (in USD).
// polka.innerHTML = response.polkadot.usd; updates the content of the HTML element with the ID "polkadot" with the current price of Polkadot (in USD).


//In summary, this JavaScript code fetches cryptocurrency prices from the CoinGecko API and updates the corresponding HTML elements on a web page with those prices. Please ensure that you have the jQuery library included in your HTML file for the $ and $.ajax to work, as they are part of jQuery's functionality.
